# DiplomaProject
This bachelor's work is devoted to the development of programs that can be used in order to simulate one-dimensional diffusion of active atoms under conditions of the effect of coherent population trapping. In the course of the work, the original system of differential equations was supplemented with conjugate equations, after which it was transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations using the integro-interpolation method. Other numerical methods for solving similar systems were also considered. Two programs were developed, with the help of which a numerical solution was obtained for a given set of parameters. This solution satisfies the conditions of the problem being solved, and its error is acceptable. In addition, based on a program in the Python programming language, testing was carried out using test functions with a known solution. The obtained solutions were compared with the expected ones, and a study was made of the dependence of the error on the number of partitions. The result of this work is two programs in the Fortran and Python programming languages that allow simulating one-dimensional diffusion of active atoms under conditions of the effect of coherent population trapping.
